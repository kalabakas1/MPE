<p>A lot of things can be done to make a developers life easier, and make him focus on the one thing he needs to do. Develop software!. This is a short description of some of the things you can do to make your fellow developers life easier on a daily basis.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>At one point I got tired of correcting stuff just to make the solution I worked on compile. This included configurations that didn't exist in the configuration files. Some of them didn't have transformations for the different environments, so they got deployed with the development values, which basically crashed the site. At the end of that day I started creating this document to make my life easier and to sum up what could be avoided of small irritating errors that might occur.</p>
<h2 id="the-list">The List!!!</h2>
<p>It is gonna be a small list that sums up the different things along with an argument that sort of legalizes it. Not gonna be religious about it, but it's something I have gotten frustrated over, which could be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="remember-to-add-configuration-transformation-items-you-create-you-transform">Remember to add configuration transformation items - you create, you transform</h3>
<p>When dealing with web applications or normal executables you might need to add something like appSettings in the .config files to differentiate between development, staging and the release environment. I spend around two hours trying to make all the configurations have the correct values, just because the developer that created didn't choose the correct values for the different environments.  You might not know the values, but you should know if it something that is gonna be transformed when building a specific environment.</p>
<h3 id="develope-in-branches-master-should-always-be-production-ready">Develope in branches - master should always be production ready</h3>
<p>There is a lot of hype regarding how to do software development, but in the current state of my work and employment it is still a best practice to create a branch if you have to do anything else then creating markdown files for documentation or something similar trivial. If you fixes a bug in production, creating a new feature - please do create a branch for it, and merge master into your branch on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 id="nothing-is-done-before-it-have-been-tested-on-qastagingsome-other-test-environment-name">Nothing is done before it have been tested on QA/staging/some-other-test-environment-name</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple, unless you have pushed it to a testing environment where you can see it works - then it is not done. When you have tested it on a test environment, then you should also have considered configuration transformations for at least that environment. After that you can mark the case as done and move on to the next interesting bit of your day.</p>
<h3 id="commit-your-code-before-you-go-home-die-get-sick-or-otherwise-leave-the-office">Commit your code before you go home, die, get sick or otherwise leave the office</h3>
<p>One of the worst things I have experienced, and properly you all have, is the setback of a coworker being sick. When that happens it should be easy for someone else to take over his work, checkout his branch and work on it as normal. But in the real world, co-workers aren't always thinking in &quot;what if&quot;'s. What if I get the flue tomorrow, can we then finish on time? So in the perfect team I would suggest that every developer work in a separate branch from the master, don't go home before committing all the work, no matter if it compiles or not. That way, if the co-worker turns in sick the next day, you can continue his work by giving him a call and checking out his code.
<strong>Commit before you stop working</strong></p>
<h3 id="dont-let-your-pride-use-the-hours-from-a-case">Don't let your pride use the hours from a case</h3>
<p>So we are all human beings, and we all have some sort of pride in what we do. But when it comes to deadlines, and tasks that already have a estimate associated with it, there just ain't room for pride. What pride does to a developer is pretty simple. Imagine that you have gotten a fairly technical task that contains a lot of new stuff for you to learn. But your dog is sick, your parents are mad because you married a farmers daughter etc. That combined with pride results in a big use of the estimated hours, without you asking for help. Wasted hours that could be spend on solving the problem. My experience is that if you get stuck doing a task, just ask someone in your team for help, and get on with it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All teams are different and this small list of stuff can't fit all teams or projects. But the essence of it is the same. Identify the irritating repetitive errors that occurs, find a solution to them, and implement the solution as a concrete deployment rule, or a culture in the team. You can even game-ify it by having a cake/beer rule - for each time a certain error occurs, the developer should bring it for the next team meeting.</p>
