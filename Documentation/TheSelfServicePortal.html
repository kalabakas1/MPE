<p>This is just gonna be a short article that describes a pretty hectic part of my year, where I worked primary with a customer that needed a way to make their users able to see standard data, and later on interact with it.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The reason that I writes this is because I see it as important. Important that the technical guys actually shares their stories, and not just letting the managers and sales people define how it went through their point of view. This might not be a new innovative solution we came up with, but the process and discoveries were interesting to experience.</p>
<p>Personally I really have to get better at writing these types of articles, that way I can gather the different solutions that I have been a part of. Because I did not do this alone - I'm just the person stupid enough to write my observations down.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The customer we had to develop a system for was a big fiber-connection company that needed to take the load off the service-desk personal. The main goal was to build a self-service environment were the customer could see their products, invoices, standard data and different codes for their products - may it be software or hardware.</p>
<p>The goal here was to let 1000 customers in during 10 minutes when they e.g. send out all the newly generated invoices that should be paid by the customers.</p>
<h2 id="spoiler-alert">Spoiler alert</h2>
<p>This is not a flaming article that only attacks the different roles in the story. It is minded on the learnings this project have thought the team, and hopefully my current employer. The resulting first fase of the system actually turned out to be a good and stable foundation for their future endeavors.</p>
<h2 id="the-formal-process">The formal process</h2>
<p>This is normally the process where the entire team sits down and finds out how they want to run this project, agile, scrum, waterfall etc. But that should not be the case in this project. Before we, the technical guys, was introduced to the project the top management had already started to define the frames for the project. We choose to use a popular project management tool with good documentation capabilities with a good strong connection to the cases that would be created during the development of the system. Likewise the top management had been sold that the agile label was the new way to do stable and flexible software development so they got a contract for a Product Owner as well.</p>
<p>Normally you would say that all these things were great. Good tools, a method of developing software that can change direction from one day to the next - personally i am actually a fan of these things, but not in this context.</p>
<p>The issue is that the company I was working for had been using a fairly old project management tool that all developers were pretty comfortable with. Fair enough, it was not the most graphical top-nutch tool, but it got the job done, and the project managers could generate what ever reports they needed without the big problems. By telling the customer that we were gonna use a new system with out asking the developers, or worst of all, not asking the assigned project manager, was pretty much a stab in the back for the team. We were without budget to learn the new project management tool, and the customer were already started to fill it with userstory data and documentation regarding all sort of business related stuff that might be useful in the future.</p>
<p>The team had nothing to say - and the project were already behind schedule because of these decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Take-away:</strong> Ask the team before saying anything to the customer regarding tooling. And if you choose not to, please do estimate some time so the team can learn to use your chosen tool.</p>
<p>But any way, what was done was done and we had nothing to say about it as a team. Which leads me to the next small thing that got to be a even bigger issue than the forced tooling. In the world of software development there are a lot of ways to do agile development. You can go all the way with all the tools, meetings, roles in the team etc. which can be great - or you can try to use concepts like userstories and product owner for a start. At some point the latter were chosen for the team (that at this point were not even defined). The issue is not that there only were chosen a few concepts to work with, the issue were that the people taking the decisions had no idea of the responsibilities a product owner had, and had not read up on what a userstory should contain to be properly groomed.</p>
<p>At this point we were forced to use a project management tool no one had experienced with, and in that tool were userstories that were not groomed properly by the product owner, that did not know his responsibilities - and by the way avoided any responsibilities at all.</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Don't sell a Product Owner skillset you don't know if the person have - it ruins a lot fo the ones who have to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>So lets get started with this already awesome project.</p>
<h2 id="technicians-entered-the-project">Technicians entered the project</h2>
<p>Finally the team was assembled. Three frontend developers of different skillset, two backenders, a designer, a project manager and off-cause the product owner (PO). We read through the documentation the customer had written and saw the different userstories that had been made. At this point we questioned the missing details regarding the userstories, because there we e.g. missing acceptance criteria, so in theory we did not know when the userstory were solved. But we took the word of the PO that this would get finalized soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>Take-away:</strong> Don�t expect that people actually do groom the stories - do follow up on it yourself.</p>
<p>We got through our first sprint-ish meeting and the project manager started to define what should be solved through the use of his new tool. So at this point the designer and frontend developers started to do their thing: a pretty simple MVC website with asynchronous content loaded from different API endpoints. At least that was what I were told the customer had bought, and what the architect had told me was the agreement at a separate meeting were we went through all the features and the infrastructure of the solution he had penned down in the project management tool (PMT)</p>
<p>So the picture of the setup are the following:</p>
<p><img src="./dumps/2018-10-18_1000.png" alt="Overall architecture" /></p>
<p>So I went on three weeks vacation during the summer with my mind at ease because all the developers knew where we were going with the project, and how it should take its form. And I could not be more wrong. That is one of the things vacation sucks at: maintaining control of the project. When me and my project manager got back from our needed vacation we were stunned with the direction the project were going.</p>
<p>All of a sudden we were developing a NodeJS application, currently based on some dummy API's using data contracts no backend developer had agreed upon. The only way to keep the web application running on production were by having a console window running on the remote desktop, and by the way, we had no way of deploying it. When I asked for the considerations regarding deployment, I were told that they thought it was okay to just copy paste the files from some random developers computer to the remote desktop enabled server. Three weeks had passed and the backend team I was a part of were currently set back two years, to the time of manually deploying artifacts because of some decisions made by some sales person, architect, frontend developer, or some other person that should have considered the question of skill and ability of deployment</p>
<p><strong>Take-away:</strong> Always ask yourself how you are gonna deploy your code before you chose some framework or other type of component.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<p>We had some work to do as deployment and operations responsible. We were in a situations were more decisions had been taken without us being a part of it. But thats not a first in this project, so we just had to make do. The first thing we had to solve was the hosting and deployment issue of the NodeJS server. Because we were dealing with GDPR tricky data, we could not just use some external vendor that automatically boots the NodeJS application up and everything works, the customer needed control of the application.</p>
<p>At this point in time we were already using TeamCity to build our code repositories and making Octopus deploy it to the target environments. So the idea were simple. Make the NodeJS application work on a Windows server so the customer do not have to buy a new server outside of the projects budget. After hours of research and frustrations regarding the decisions a colleague of mine found a, some what, stable hosting and configuration setup that could be build, transformed and deployed through the current pipeline configuration. SUCCESS!!!</p>
<p><strong>Take-away:</strong> People that builds the components should be the ones running the ops part of it as well</p>
<p>At this point we were deploying four sites to a webserver, and three services to a  microservice(worker) server - it was a minimum viable setup, and still not even finished with fase one. Everything could be build and deployed in about eight minutes (add four more minutes and it could be on production as well).</p>
<p>Some of the frustrating things about working with new technology as NodeJS is that you do not have the skills and knowhow to know how it fits in with &quot;normal&quot; and planned infrastructure. An example could be that to limit the toil in the future I proposed to have a proxy in front of the servers to handle the SSL certificate. That way it would be terminated at the proxy level, and we should not do anything to our deployment pipeline and configuration. It worked for three out of four sites. Guess what site ruined that plan.</p>
<p>The time were limited because the customer were doing UAT with the QA department and the entire infrastructure (as they saw it) were down. Another stab in the back by NodeJS. So we had to reverse the proxy idea and instead make the DNS point directly to the webserver and handle the toil of setting up bindings with new SSL certificates now and in the futures, along with reconfiguring the pipeline to choose the correct certificate at deployment. World is a happy place - that is when nothing changes, and no one takes a monkey out of his pocket and lets it loose in the datacenter (that would be NodeJS in this case).</p>
<p><strong>Take-away:</strong> Do have a QA setup that resembles the planned production setup. We were without a proxy server so we did not know the problems before it hit the customer in the face. Note to sales-personal: if you sell these projects, please sell the customers a proper QA and development environment as well.</p>
