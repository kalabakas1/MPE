# Subject List
Just a small list containing the areas I really want to write some sort of "article" about. Or just to produce some notes regarding these subjects. I think it can be fun and have a benefit for me in the future to do this effort when I have time

## Subjects
* Automatic deployment with Octopus and TeamCity
* MongoDb - its use and how to use it 101
* ElasticSearch - how to implement search across different object types
* Avoiding to install components on dev machines
* Coding guidelines and why they should be there (Stylecop)
* Focusing and tricks to achieve it
